        <h1>Get Insights On Covid-19</h1>
        <p>Our motive is to consist  an user-friendly platform which is compatible with everyone’s intellect and whatever devices they are using to access data. A diverse impact has fallen to our everyday lifestyle and many changes have taken place in this COVID-19 pandemic. With the economy plummeting in a dangerous manner where we might head towards a recession, it is our small gesture and an effort to provide insights on what is happening around the world. In this people can have the right knowledge and prepare for what is coming up next. We want them to see what we see, via the right visualisation.

          <h3>Spread Of Covid-19</h3>
          <p>COVID-19 – otherwise known as Coronavirus disease – has been dominating the headlines recently. It is spreading quickly across parts of Asia and beyond.This coronavirus is spreading at a breakneck speed and it is important to put all the necessary resources into halting it. We may not know enough about the virus’s impact on children or how many may be affected – but we do know that close monitoring and prevention are key. Time is not on our side.Like in US.<a href="spreadseemore.html">See More</a></p>

          <h3>Employment</h3>
          <p>Hundreds of millions of people could be left without work due to the impact of COVID-19, the UN’s work agency warns.
Current G7 jobless totals vary widely, from 30 million in the United States to 1.76 million in Japan.
Several European governments have softened rise in unemployment with generous wages subsidies.
Since the pandemic hit, claims for unemployment benefits have soared in some countries – notably the US – and by far less in others, for example, Japan.<a href="employmentseemore.html">See More</a></p>

          <h3>Transportablity</h3>
          <p>The use of public transportation during the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic has been implicated in spreading the disease; "researchers found that a bus passenger infected fellow travellers sitting 4.5 metres away".[1] A study published in the academic journal Practical Preventive Medicine found that "in a closed environment with air-conditioning, the transmission distance of the new coronavirus will exceed the commonly recognised safe distance.<a href="transseemore.html">See More</a></p>
